Assuming that you already have a system for detecting handwriting using OCR, here the next task is given an input image that contains handwritten text, and an image we have to extract the image from the text.

# Image_Extraction
Here the code for extracting images from an image or a scanned book is attached.


# Input
All the input files can be found in /content/sample_data/ folder in colab named as:
1. download.jpeg
2. images1.jpeg
3. images2.jpeg
4. Capture.png
5. urinary.jpeg

# Output
All the output files can be found in /content/sample_data/output folder in colab. Here some text containing images are also detected but this problem can be solved by adding a system for detecting handwriting using OCR.
